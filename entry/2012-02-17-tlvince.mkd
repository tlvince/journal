abstract: The evolution of my website
tags: project

Building websites as a hobby since 2005, it was only a matter of time before I
made one for myself. It has served as an ongoing experiment ever since. This
post details its evolution, in reverse chronological order.

## Third iteration

The third iteration saw a major rewrite from [Wordpress to toto][wp2toto]. I
wanted to see how far I could take minimalism: this iteration runs on toto, a
tiny Ruby-based blog engine.

Gone was the bloated MySQL database-PHP combination; replaced with a subtle
blend of plain-text files, `git` and Heroku. Everything is based on open source
software, [even the site itself][gh].

The design compliments the backend minimalism. Aiming to be as readable as
possible, it uses a [warm colour pallette][solarized] and focuses purely on the
*content*.

## Second iteration

From humble beginnings of handwritten HTML, I next dived into Wordpress; the
PHP-powered blogging engine, using the fantastic [Journalist theme][journo] by
Lucian E. Marin. The purpose of my site changed from less of a programming
experiment, more of a blogging experiment.

For my [year in Hong Kong][hk], I updated to the default [Twenty Ten][2010]
theme, with a banner of [Victoria Harbour][vh].

## First iteration

`tlvince.com` was born circa January, 2007. Initiated from a school interest,
this baby was a `notepad` masterpiece (or so I thought at the time). I was
learning CSS, evident by the curious `div` background colours. I'm not sure it
ever worked in the new browser on the block: Firefox 2, but why would anyone
click on anything but the "blue e"?
