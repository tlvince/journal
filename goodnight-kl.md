I leave KL unable to make up my mind about it. On the one hand, it has a very
westernised feel; the Pratronas Towers towering over all, yet it is jammed with
small markets and undeveloped areas. I suppose put in that way, it sounds a lot
like Hong Kong.

I spent my remanding full day in the Batu Caves. Definitely worth a visit.
